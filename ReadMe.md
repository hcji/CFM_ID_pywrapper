This package is a python warpper for [CFM-ID](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cfm-id/) which provides a method for accurately 
and efficiently identifying metabolites in spectra generated by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The program 
uses Competitive Fragmentation Modeling to produce a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS fragmentation process and machine 
learning techniques to adapt the model parameters from data.
